  This Python program functions as a basic calculator with a graphical ASCII
  interface. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations including
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The user
  is prompted to enter two numbers and choose an operation from a menu. After
  performing the calculation, the result is displayed, and the user can choose
  to continue with the result or start a new calculation. The script supports
  multiple calculations in a single session and recursively restarts if the user
  chooses to continue.
