description: >-
  Implements a basic Blackjack game where users play against a computer. The
  game starts by dealing two cards to both the user and the computer. Users can
  choose to draw more cards or pass. The computer draws cards until it reaches a
  score of at least 17. The script calculates and compares scores to determine
  the winner, handles cases where the user or computer busts, and displays the
  results. Players are given the option to play multiple rounds by restarting
  the game if they choose.
