description: >-
  A random word is selected from a predefined list and the user is prompted to
  guess letters. The game provides visual feedback through an ASCII
  representation of a hangman's gallows, which updates with each incorrect
  guess. Players start with six lives and lose one with each wrong guess. The
  game continues until the player either guesses the entire word correctly or
  loses all their lives. The script displays the current state of the word with
  guessed letters revealed and underscores for remaining letters, and shows the
  corresponding hangman stage to indicate the number of remaining lives.
